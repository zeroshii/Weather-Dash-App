# Server-Side APIs: Weather-Dashboard

This is a web application that retrieves and displays weather data from the third-party [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. This application allows a traveler to plan a trip accordingly when looking at the weather outlook for multiple cities.

See the deployed application here: [Weather Dashboard](https://zeroshii.github.io/Weather-Dash-App/)

# Functionality
The weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The API will retrieve weather data for cities. When the user inputs a city into the search bar, they will then be presented with the current and future 5-day forecast of weather conditions for that city. This will contain city name, dates, icon representations of the weather conditions, temperatures, humidity, wind speeds, and the UV index. The UV index of the current day is colour-coded to indicate whether it is favourable (green), moderate (yellow), or severe (red). The city name will also be added to the search history. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they will be presented again with the current and future conditions for that city. When the weather dashboard is open again, the last searched city forecast will be presented.
